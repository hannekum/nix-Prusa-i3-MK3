# Summary

Extruder ventilator on Prusa i3 slightly whirls the air on suction side of the extruder, which resolves in unintended cooling of one side of printed objects. When printing (especially with ABS), this can lead to worse bed adhesion of the object on this side.

This fan cover blocks the air going down toward heatbed. The MK3 version also masks the color of the ventilator a bit.

The MK2 version is mounted with screws that holds the ventilator.
The MK3 version just snaps on the ventilator (no screws needed, holds very well on spot).


# Print Settings

Printer: Prusa i3 MK3
Rafts: No
Supports: Yes

Notes: 
Recommended print settings (Prusa Slic3r):
ABS/PET (dont use PLA - it is too close to extruder and heatbed)
Perimeters: 2-3
0.2 layer hight
Auto cooling: ON

MK3 version:
Must be printed with support!
Detect bridging: ON

*Presliced GCODE for MK3 is included (ABS, 0.2 layer height).

# Updates

## Update 1

Added new MK3 version (ver2) which can be printed without any support and also covers bottom of the fan.

\* Special thanks to RiDDLeRN for this idea.

# Summary

This is the perfect mischmasch of user JLTX's design, which I like for its flatness and overall shape and FF8Jake's design which has the nicest way of attaching the feet to the frame. His feet are just to large (I mean, to high).

Print four or even six of them and put them under your MK3 to eliminate a lot of the ringing/ghosting that the standard rubber feet introduce.

I recommend to use six of them for maximal frame rigidity

You will need
4-6 1inch (in reality I mean 2.5cm) felt stickers of roughly 3 mm thickness (I expect that 2mm should also work)
4-6 M5 bolts of 10mm length
4-6 drop-in t-nuts (M5, slot width 8mm), so no disassembly of the frame is necessary in order to attach these. A possible source would be http://a.co/d/bGWZyh3 but they are really not hard to find (On ebay.de I can find them with "hammermutter nut 8 M5". There are also printable t-nuts on thingiverse. I was stripping their threads, so I ordered some metal ones and never looked back

How to assemble:

I suggest to put the drop-in t-nuts first into the frame's slot. Then use two small screw drivers (or other tools) to turn them 90 degrees. Then put the printed part into position and aim with the screw at the t-nut. Fasten the screw nearly fully and move the feet into it's final position. Now fasten the screw completely. Now stick the felt pad on the bottom of the foot. You could pierce a hole in the middle of the felt pad so you can reach the screw later before attaching. But it is no problem to do that later if you ever have the need to unscrew the foot.

Thank you JLTX and FF8Jake for your nice work!

History:
2018/9/3: First version
2018/9/4: Cleaned up the design source file a little and added chamfers for even easier installation
2018/9/8: I successfully installed the feet on my MK3 - they are awesome. I used the feet with felt. I also tried if the normal feet are high enough to be used without felt - they are not! So if you plan to use rigid feet without a felt pad, I recommend you use the new stl "Rigid_feet_for_MK3_higher_no_felt.stl" - I do not use those - I would be happy to receive feedback on those as well:-)
2018/9/14: I uploaded the Fusion360 file - so if you need another height or want to use different screws, you could adopt it now to your own needs


# Print Settings

Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2
Infill: 40%

Notes: 
It is important to print these with no supports and 0.2mm layer height.

Use as much perimeters and infill as you like. Personally I chose 4 perimeters and 40% gyroid infill.

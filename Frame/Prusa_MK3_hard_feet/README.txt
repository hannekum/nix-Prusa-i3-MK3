# Summary

The stock rubber feet allow for some resonance on high accelerations.  Some folks have seen better results with hard feet, helping reduce the prominence of ringing and vertical banding.  I had good luck with the old MK2 feet that used felt since I use a paver stone as a base.  So I made these to twist into the MK3 extrusions and accept 1" furniture felt pads.  

Print as is with normal settings, 0.2 mm layer.  Print 4 at once for ease.
The two pieces snap together.  Add M3x10 and nut and fully tighten, then back off 3/4 of a turn.   Insert into extrusion and twist 90 degrees into position, slide up against frame and tighten down screw for ultimate stability (see photo).  You could attach other adhesive feet like sorbothane.  

For felt pads, drill 1/8" hole in center before attaching so you can access screw.  I could not find thin enough pads, so after attaching, I used a razor blade to shave down to about 2mm thickness.  This provides maximum grip with minimum flex.

BTW, the t-nut here is handy for other projects where you want to attach something to the 30mm extrusion.  The hex coupler is inscribed 6.92mm and 2mm deep.

# More parts

I have many parts for MK3. I like them all, but here is what I recommend to tighten things up and improve reliability and print quality.  This is based on my own experience using these parts and from others using the same or similar upgrades.  YMMV.
[Z mounts](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2779123) - fix alignment, sturdier
[Y endstop](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2942590) - fix layer shift, long term reliability
[hard feet](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2805753) - reduce vibrations
[stable pulley](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2763870) - stabilize belt, longevity
[runner](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2727093) - offload frame, poor man's reverse-bowden

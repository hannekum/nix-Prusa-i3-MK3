# Summary

A small remix for users that do not like the two screws on the idler for the smooth rods, aka same as stock MK3 X-Ends.

Parts affected are X-MotorHolder and X-Idler, X-Tensioner is included just for convenience. NOTE, the X-ends work only in combination (as a pair).

Please note that the X axis tensioner uses GT2 16 smooth or toothed pulley instead of the stock GT2 20 pulley (my personal opinion backed with data points, is that either smooth or toothed pulleys will work just fine for the current application). 

You can find the X-carriage for the modified pulley size and the revised extruder here (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2843264). If you dont want to print the extruder, a carriage compatible with the stock R3 extruder can be found here (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3078619)

Considering this is a very small remix, please find more information about post processing and assembly here (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2846079). Besides using less fasteners, the instructions are the same.

STEP files are included for your modding pleasure and convenience. STL files were sliced and checked with Slic3r PE.

Any constructive feedback is welcomed.

EDIT (01/09/2018): Version cleanup. Only left the ones with clamps.
